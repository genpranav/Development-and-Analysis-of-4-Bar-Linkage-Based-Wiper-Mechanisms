In this project the application of basic physics (Slider-Crank mechanism) 
to create manipulatable simulation a wiper mechanism to visualize 
its functioning is acheived. In our case the wiper mechanism 
is a "bottom-middle pivoted synchronous dual arm wiper".

\
The features of this project are :
1. GUI
2. SIMULATION
3. ERROR HANDLING
4. FILE SAVE
5. GRAPHS


# Wiper Mechanism model Application using Matlab

In this project, I built an application using the rudimentary physics of a **4 bar linkage mechanism**(specifically Slider-Crank mechanism) to create a manipulatable simulation of a wiper mechanism to visualize its functional components and perform practical analysis using Matlab. In our case the wiper mechanism 
is a "bottom-middle pivoted synchronous dual arm wiper".


> ! To be able to run the demo through the app the user is first required to evaluate the model parameters which are required to conform to the 
>>**Grashof's Law**. (== evaluate before run)

\
The features of this project are :
1. GUI
2. SIMULATION
3. ERROR HANDLING
4. MODEL SAVE
5. PLOTS

We use the general metrics to generate the following plots of the model,

\
This project allowed me to experience the empirical process of full-scale product/model development.
